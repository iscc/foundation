Commercial interests of many stakeholders depend on proper identification of digital content . Professionally produced digital content but also semi-professional and user-generated content are the currency of the information age. A variety of specific content identifier standards already exist, but a universal content-dependent identifier for digital assets has not yet been developed. In particular, the structure and management of identifiers for digital content have a substantial impact on the level of possible adoption, automation, and the potential for machine-to-machine communication and innovation within and across different industry sectors. Digital content is dynamic, always in motion, and acted upon globally by a variety of entities with different interests and requirements. Digital content continuously re-encodes, resizes, and re-compresses, changing its underlying data as it travels through a complex network of actors and systems. The International Standard Content Code (ISCC) is a proposal for universal identifier for digital assets that encode text, images, audio, video or other content. The ISCC is generated from the digital content itself. It is the result of processing the digital content using a variety of hash algorithms. The generated code supports data integrity verification and also preserves an estimate of the data , digital content and metadata similarity. However, ISCC is not a replacement for a content recognition system . The ISCC bridges the gap between higher-level content identifiers like work and product identifiers and their relations to digitally encoded manifestations of content . Because the ISCC is a content-dependent identifier, it does not necessarily require a registration authority. The ISCC does not specify a system for managing authoritative metadata . Other content identifier standards can use ISCC to support discoverability of their identifiers and metadata based on digital content . The ISCC enables interoperability at the level of the digital asset and supports scenarios that require content deduplication, integrity verification, timestamping, versioning, data provenance, fact-checking and general digital asset management use-cases at regional, national or international scale. Standardization # The ISCC will be even more useful the more users agree on the suggested standard procedure of hashing the content in order to create the content\u2019s unique ID.

Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, CC BY-SA 4.0, Sebastian Posth , ISCC:CYaHPGcucqwe3 Sabine R\u00fcsch has been nominated as Convenor of the newly established working group. R\u00fcsch is also Chairwoman of the working group (NID) NA 009-00-09 AA (Beschreibung und Identifizierung von Dokumenten) at German DIN, who accepted the standardization proposal for the ISCC in January 2019. The ISCC has been proposed as a generic content identifier for digital media content in different formats across various industries. Like a fingerprint, the ISCC is created from the content file itself. It can be used to identify digital content and support rights management in decentralized media environments on the blockchain as well as in local repositories. In order to promote the project and to continue the work on the specification, the ISCC Foundation has been set up in Leiden in the Netherlands. Kira Lemke, Titusz Pan and Sebastian Posth will serve as the initial members of the board, which will be extended by further members and industry experts in the future.
