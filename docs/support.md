# Become a Supporter

The **ISCC Foundation** is an independent international **nonprofit** organization. In order to reach our goals, you can support us in various ways:

## Donations

Individual or regular financial contributions or donations are welcome. They support the development and communication of the **ISCC Standard**. You might be able to deduct your donation from the tax. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding tax deductions.

## Endorsements

We appreciate non-monetary endorsements from interested parties. The ISCC currently is a new work item proposal at the proposal stage at [ISO/TC 46/SC 9](https://iso.org/committee/48836.html). But any standard will only be relevant, if it is being adopted and used by the community. You can help the ISCC Foundation significantly by proliferating news and information about the ISCC and by linking to the specification and available applications.

## Workshops and Online-Courses

The Foundation will be offering workshops and online-courses to provide knowledge and information about the **ISCC**. Feel free to reach out if you would like to learn about open, interoperable and decentralized content identifier technology and how the **ISCC** can be useful for your project and organization. 

## Contributions

- Contribute to the **ISCC Specification** or **Reference Implementation**  via [Github](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-specs)
- Give us your feedback or request new features via [Github Issues](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-specs/issues) 

## Development

The **ISCC** can be useful to identify content in transactions on blockchain networks. But it can also be used off-blockchain or even offline. 
Feel free to reach out to us and engage with the technology. Find out how the **ISCC** can be of use for you and how you can apply the technology to your business or production processes. We would like to encourage the cultural community, media companies and start-ups to get familiar with the **ISCC** and build applications and services on top of the technology.
