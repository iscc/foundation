Other content identifier standards can use ISCC to support discoverability of their identifiers and metadata based on digital content.</p> <p>The ISCC enables interoperability at the level of the digital asset and supports scenarios that require content deduplication, integrity verification, timestamping, versioning, data provenance, fact-checking and general digital asset management use-cases at regional, national or international scale.</p>"},{"location":"iscc/#please-visit-our-new-site-at-isccio","title":"Please visit our new site at iscc.io","text":""},{"location":"iscc/#standardization","title":"Standardization","text":"<p>The ISCC will be even more useful the more users agree on the suggested standard procedure of hashing the content in order to create the content\u2019s unique code.
